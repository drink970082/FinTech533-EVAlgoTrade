## Concept

TSLA and RIVN both sit under the "EV manufacturer" label, but let's be honestâ€”are they really that similar?  
RIVN is pretty straightforward - a pure EV company.  
But what about TSLA? Considering the "X-factor" i.e. Elon Musk, will TSLA still be a pure EV manufacturer?

So, what is the opportunity?  

Look at the statistics from past three years:

TSLA and RIVN are almost not related! Can we use this to do a "reversed" pair trading?  

Our strategy concept is as follows:

1. Since they are both EV producers, there's some short-term relationship that we can capture.
2. Once they are close-related, we bet their spread to diverge. Here we long TSLA and short RIVN because of "Elon factor".
3. We exit if the relationship still exists for a long time, or waiting them to diverge and take the profit.

## Pair Trading Strategy Overview

::: {.callout-note title="Trading Setup"}
- **Trading Time**: Past three years
- **Data Frequency**: Daily resolution
- **Hedge Ratio Window**: 20 days
- **Cointegration Test Window**: 60 days
- **Trading Session Timeout**: 20 days
:::

---

## Strategy Logic

1. **Calculate Hedge Ratio**  
   Compute the hedge ratio $\beta_i$ based on the past 20 days of log prices:
   $$
   \beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(\log P_{\text{RIVN}}, \log P_{\text{TSLA}})}{\text{Var}(\log P_{\text{TSLA}})}
   $$
   Then using hedge ratio to hold a notional value of $10000 position of both stocks

2. **Compute Spread and Z-Score**
   $$
   \text{Spread}_t = \log(P_{\text{RIVN}, t}) - \beta_i \cdot \log(P_{\text{TSLA}, t})\\
   $$
   $$
   z_t = \frac{\text{Spread}_t-\text{mean}({\text{Spread}_{t-20:t}})}{\text{std}(\text{Spread}_{t-20:t})}
   $$

3. **Cointegration Test**  
   Test 60-day rolling window of log prices for cointegration using the ADF test.

4. **Z-Score Based Trading Rules**  
   If cointegration is statistically significant $p<0.05$:
   - **Entry**: if $|Z| < 1$
   - **Exit**: if $|Z| > 2.5$

   Here we long TSLA and short RIVN.

5. **Trading Session Timeout**  
   Exit trades when:
   - trade lasting over 20 days, and
   - $|Z| < 1$ and $p<0.05$ (still reverting)

#### Summary
Notice that most of our returns come from $\alpha$, not riding each asset's movement.  
We reaches almost market neutral regarding RIVN moves, and a moderate benefit when TSLA rises.  
This shows our strategy controlled directional exposure with alpha-driven returns, and we capture divergence opportunities effectively.

## Reflection and Future Work

1. Despite connection as EV manufacturers, TSLA isn't just an EV company. Thanks to Elon Musk, TSLA is a tech powerhouse with a strong personality.
2. Flipping the traditional pair trading strategy approaches to bet the divergence makes profit. At the end of the day, TSLA and RIVN will keep moving to their own beats, and we'll be there to capture value every time the market forgets that.
3. While the strategy delivers strong returns, its relatively high per-trade volatility highlights the importance of disciplined risk management and patience in waiting for optimal setups.
4. Relying on only one pair limits trading opportunities. In the future we plan to extend our trading pairs to other EV companies (LCID, BYDDF) or traditional automakers transitioning to EV (F, GM).
