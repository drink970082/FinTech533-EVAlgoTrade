## Strategy Logic

1. **Calculate Hedge Ratio**  
   Compute the hedge ratio $\beta_i$ based on the past 20 days of log prices:
   $$
   \beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(\log P_{\text{RIVN}}, \log P_{\text{TSLA}})}{\text{Var}(\log P_{\text{TSLA}})}
   $$
   Then using hedge ratio to hold a notional value of $10000 position of both stocks

2. **Compute Spread and Z-Score**
   $$
   \text{Spread}_t = \log(P_{\text{RIVN}, t}) - \beta_i \cdot \log(P_{\text{TSLA}, t})\\
   $$
   $$
   z_t = \frac{\text{Spread}_t-\text{mean}({\text{Spread}_{t-20:t}})}{\text{std}(\text{Spread}_{t-20:t})}
   $$

3. **Cointegration Test**  
   Test 60-day rolling window of log prices for cointegration using the ADF test.

4. **Z-Score Based Trading Rules**  
   If cointegration is statistically significant $p<0.05$:
   - **Entry**: if $|Z| < 1$
   - **Exit**: if $|Z| > 2.5$

   Here we long TSLA and short RIVN.

5. **Trading Session Timeout**  
   Exit trades when:
   - trade lasting over 20 days, and
   - $|Z| < 1$ and $p<0.05$ (still reverting)

#### Summary
Most of the returns are attributable to **alpha**, not passive exposure to either stock.
Our strategy achieves **near market-neutrality** with respect to RIVN, and gains a **moderate positive sensitivity** to TSLA’s upside — consistent with our thesis.
This confirms our model successfully isolates pricing divergences and avoids directional bias.

## Reflection and Future Work

1. ** TSLA ≠ Just an EV Company **
   - One important thing for this strategy is understanding that Tesla isn’t just building electric vehicles as it’s also involved in AI, robotics, and energy.
   - The stock tends to move based on Elon Musk’s public actions, news headlines, and tech market sentiment, not just EV fundamentals.
   - In the earnings report 1Q of 2025 showed a signficant decline of 71% of net income and revenue falling 9% a year, but the stock actually went up!
   - As such, Elon's fanbase (the Elon Musk Factor) makes TSLA behave differently from a company like RIVN, which is much more focused on vehicle production alone.

2. **Reversing the Traditional Pair Trade**
   - In most pair strategies, traders bet two related stocks will converge back together after moving apart.
   - Instead of betting on convergence, we anticipate divergence between TSLA and RIVN when they appear temporarily correlated.
   - This contrarian approach takes advantage of market misperceptions.

3. **Managing Risk and Timing**
   - Although the strategy delivers strong returns, the high per-trade volatility demands disciplined risk management and patience to wait for valid signals.
   - To control this, we set strict entry and exit rules, limit trade duration to 20 days, and only enter trades when there is clear cointegration.

4. **Expanding the Strategy Universe**
   - Currently, the strategy is based on a single pair.
   - Future work includes adding other EV stocks (e.g., LCID, BYDDF) and legacy automakers transitioning to EV (e.g., Ford, GM) to scale opportunity and diversify risk.
   - We may also use clustering algorithms to group similar stocks based on historical price behavior and fundamentals, helping us find more profitable and uncorrelated pair combinations.
