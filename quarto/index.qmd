## Welcome to EVAlgoTrade

TSLA and RIVN both sit under the "EV manufacturer" label, but let's be honestâ€”are they really that similar?  
RIVN is pretty straightforward - a pure EV company.  
But what about TSLA? Considering the "X-factor" i.e. Elon Musk, will TSLA still be a pure EV manufacturer?

So, what is the opportunity?  

Look at the statistics from past three years:

TSLA and RIVN are almost not related! Can we use this to do a "reversed" pair trading?  

Our strategy concept is as follows:

1. Since they are both EV producers, there's some short-term relationship that we can capture.
2. Once they are close-related, we bet their spread to diverge. Here we long TSLA and short RIVN because of "Elon factor".
3. We exit if the relationship still exists for a long time, or waiting them to diverge and take the profit.
