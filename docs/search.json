    "text": "7 Reflection and Future Work\n\n** TSLA ≠ Just an EV Company **\n\nOne important thing for this strategy is understanding that Tesla isn’t just building electric vehicles as it’s also involved in AI, robotics, and energy.\nThe stock tends to move based on Elon Musk’s public actions, news headlines, and tech market sentiment, not just EV fundamentals.\nIn the earnings report 1Q of 2025 showed a signficant decline of 71% of net income and revenue falling 9% a year, but the stock actually went up!\nAs such, Elon’s fanbase (the Elon Musk Factor) makes TSLA behave differently from a company like RIVN, which is much more focused on vehicle production alone.\n\nReversing the Traditional Pair Trade\n\nIn most pair strategies, traders bet two related stocks will converge back together after moving apart.\nInstead of betting on convergence, we anticipate divergence between TSLA and RIVN when they appear temporarily correlated.\nThis contrarian approach takes advantage of market misperceptions.\n\nManaging Risk and Timing\n\nAlthough the strategy delivers strong returns, the high per-trade volatility demands disciplined risk management and patience to wait for valid signals.\nTo control this, we set strict entry and exit rules, limit trade duration to 20 days, and only enter trades when there is clear cointegration.\n\nExpanding the Strategy Universe\n\nCurrently, the strategy is based on a single pair.\nFuture work includes adding other EV stocks (e.g., LCID, BYDDF) and legacy automakers transitioning to EV (e.g., Ford, GM) to scale opportunity and diversify risk.\nWe may also use clustering algorithms to group similar stocks based on historical price behavior and fundamentals, helping us find more profitable and uncorrelated pair combinations."
