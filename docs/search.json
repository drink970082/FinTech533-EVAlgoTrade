    "text": "8 Reflection and Future Work\n\nDespite connection as EV manufacturers, TSLA isn’t just an EV company. Thanks to Elon Musk, TSLA is a tech powerhouse with a strong personality.\nFlipping the traditional pair trading strategy approaches to bet the divergence makes profit. At the end of the day, TSLA and RIVN will keep moving to their own beats, and we’ll be there to capture value every time the market forgets that.\nWhile the strategy delivers strong returns, its relatively high per-trade volatility highlights the importance of disciplined risk management and patience in waiting for optimal setups.\nRelying on only one pair limits trading opportunities. In the future we plan to extend our trading pairs to other EV companies (LCID, BYDDF) or traditional automakers transitioning to EV (F, GM)."
